    <repeatofinfo>BALLAD OF BOOKER T. by Langston Hughes</repeatofinfo><!--By looking at these early drafts, one can see how Hughes developed his concepts and improved the poem's language over time. 
    The series of revisions may reveal adjustments to the poem's structure, tone changes, and focus shifts. -->
   <!-- The rough drafts could provide viewers a sense of the historical and cultural background for the poem's composition.
    Hughes's writing frequently addressed the African American experience, social justice, and racial identity concerns.-->
    <line1><person>Booker T.</person></line1>
    <line2>Was a practical man.</line2>
    <line3>He said, Till the soil</line3>
    <line4>And learn from the land.</line4>
    <line5>Let down your bucket</line5>
    <line6>Where you are.</line6>
    <line7>Your fate is here</line7>
    <line8>And not afar.</line8>
    <line9>To help yourself</line9>
    <line10>And your fellow man,</line10>
    <line11>Train your head,</line11>
    <line12><revisedline>Your heart, and your hand.</revisedline></line12>
    <line13>For smartness alone's</line13>
    <line14>Surely not meet—</line14>
    <line15>If you haven't at the same time</line15>
    <line16>Got something to eat.</line16>
    <line17>Thus at Tuskegee</line17>
    <line18>He built a school</line18>
    <line19>With book-learning there</line19>
    <line20>And the workman's tool.</line20>
    <line21>He started out</line21>
    <line22>In a simple way—</line22>
    <line23>For yesterday</line23>
    <line24>Was not today</line24>. 
    <line25><revisedline>Sometimes he had</revisedline></line25>
    <line26><revisedline>Compromise in his talk</revisedline>—</line26>
    <line27>For a man must crawl</line27>
    <line28>Before he can walk—</line28>
    <line29>And in Alabama in '85</line29>
    <line30>A joker was lucky</line30>
    <line31>To be alive.</line31>
    <line32>But <person>Booker T</person>.</line32>
    <line33>Was nobody's fool:</line33>
    <line44><revisedline>You may carve a dream</revisedline></line44>
    <line45>With an humble tool.</line45>
    <line46>The tallest tower</line46>
    <line47>Can tumble down</line47>
    <line48>If it be not rooted</line48>
    <line49>In solid ground.</line49>
    <line50><revisedline>So, being a far-seeing</revisedline> </line50>
    <line51><revisedline>Practical man</revisedline>,</line51>
    <line52><revisedline>He said, Train your head</revisedline>,</line52>
    <line53>Your heart, and your hand.</line53>
    <line54>Your fate is here</line54>
    <line55>And not afar,</line55> <!--What are the dashes or underlines for in the draft images?-->
    <line56>So let down your bucket</line56><!--The poem references his famous speech, "Cast Down Your Bucket Where You Are," where he urged 
    African Americans to make the best of their current circumstances rather than seeking salvation elsewhere.-->
    <line57>Where you are.</line57> LANGSTON HUGHES Final Draft, Hollow Hills Farm, Monterey,
